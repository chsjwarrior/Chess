# Chess
A chess game implemented using bitboard techniques
I already implemented something like this in java and now I want to implement it in C++ which is lighter and faster than java.

The graphical interface of the project is made using the OLC: PixelGameEngine: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine
